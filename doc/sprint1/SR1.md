## Participants

- Li Sha Su 213581772
- Mingdi Yi 218296020

## Unfinished Tasks
1. Subtasks from user story: As an instructor, I want to be able to easily mark down if a student is present or absent, so I have a list of who is in class on a given day.
   1. Connect front and back end
   2. Database storage of attendance status for current day 
2. Subtasks from user story: As an instructor, I want to look back on each week, month, and semester, so I can see each student's history of attendance.
   1. Process to add one day's attendance status to database
   2. Connect front and back end

**New user story**: As an instructor, I want the list of attendance records to automatically update when I submit the attendance status for all the students in my class.

3. Subtasks from user story: As a teaching assistant, I want to log into the same system used by the instructor I am working under, so I can assist with reporting attendance.
   1. Add user accounts to database
   2. Process to run after user account created, and to check user credentials for subsequent login
   3. Assign specific class attendance records to TA and instructor accounts

New user story is not needed, the same features still need to be implemented for this user story to be completed.

## Practices to continue in the next sprint
- Divide work by features for each person to work on
- Individual working branches on GitHub
- Frequent communication on Discord
- Frequent commits and clean merges to Main

## New practices to use during next sprint
- Meet earlier in the time after the sprint is assigned
- More frequent pushing code to the repository so all team members can view

## Harmful practices to stop using during next sprint
- Lack of communication when one person needs to change the meeting time
- Working too close to the deadline

## Best / worst experience during sprint 1
- **Jada**: Best experience was realizing I remember how to use react and being able to make the prototype for the front end quickly. Worst experience was spending 8 hours trying to figure out the database only for it to not work, and ending up just creating a prototype with basic Java classes instead.
