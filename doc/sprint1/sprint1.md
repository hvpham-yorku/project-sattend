## Sprint Goal
Build the basic attendance marking functionality, attendance history viewing, and user login system.

## User Stories to be completed
### Story 1:
As an instructor, I want to be able to easily mark down if a student is present or absent, so I have a list of who is in class on a given day.

**Tasks:**
1. Set up attendance marking UI
2. Database storage of attendance status for current day
3. Connect front and back end

### Story 2:
As an instructor, I want to look back on each week, month, and semester, so I can see each student's history of attendance.  

**Tasks:**
1. Process to add one day's attendance status to database
2. Index each day's attendance to the particular day, and log over a time period (ex. 1 week, month, semester)
3. UI for user to access historical attendance status
4. Connect front and back end

### Story 3:
As a teaching assistant, I want to log into the same system used by the instructor I am working under, so I can assist with reporting attendance.

**Tasks:**
1. Set up UI for user login
2. Add user accounts to database
3. Process to run after user account created, and to check user credentials for subsequent login
4. Assign specific class attendance records to TA and instructor accounts

## Team Capacity
