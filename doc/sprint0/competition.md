## Why Competitors Have Not Focused on These Apps
Many existing solutions primarily serve as basic attendance logs without the ability to support multi-user collaboration or institutional-wide reporting. They often lack customization options for different school structures and fail to provide a comprehensive overview of attendance trends over time.

Our product integrates these features that competitors do not have:
- infrastructure to enable real-time collaboration and access for multiple users.
- flexibility to support diverse attendance tracking needs beyond standard class schedules.
- integration with school administration tools, including student information systems and reporting platforms.
