# Objective
Build an application for tracking daily student attendance. The attendance records over each week will provide insights to instructors and office administrative staff throughout the academic year. 

# Key Personas
Emily is a professor in the Computer Science department of a large university who has been teaching for over 15 years. She has a very busy schedule with little time for administrative tasks like taking attendance, and dislikes inefficiency. She likes straightforward digital solutions which simplify her workflow.

Joshua is a secretary for the office of a high school. He recently graduated from college with a diploma in office administration, and relates well to the students that come in and out of the office due to being close in age, while he has a harder time getting along with his older co-workers, who are often caught up in the traditional way of completing office work.

# Key Scenario
1. A portion of the grade in Emily's classes is in-class attendance. Currently, to check which students are present, while she lectures, Emily has her TAs match students in-class to the list of students registered with their ID photos and record them in an Excel file which calculates overall attendane at the end of the semester. This takes a long time for TAs to do in each class, and every semester they need to recreate the excel file and all its formulas for the new group of students.

2. Since attendance is mandatory for high school students, Joshua needs to contact parents when a student is absent for multiple days without advance notice. Right now he manually checks the attendance logs for each day, which is a long process with a high margin for error.

# Key Principles
Ease of use and insights first. The design should be intuitive and approachable for users, giving them easy insight to their attendance data, even if it adds complexity to the system.
