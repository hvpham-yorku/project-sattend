## Decision Making
- **Brain Storming:** The team generated and shared multiple ideas before narrowing down to options.
  
- **Pros and Cons Analysis:** Each option was evaluated based on its advantages and disadvantages to make an informed choice.
- **Majority Voting:** When there was a disagreement, the team used majority voting to select the most most favoured option.
- **Consensus-based decision-making:** Every member's perspective was considered before reaching an agreement.


## Defining priorities and User Story Points
- **Prioritization:** Based on the complexity of each task and previous experience
  
- **Voting Round:** 2 rounds of voting to reach consensus

## Meeting Frequency
- **Sprint Planning:** At the start of sprint0, the team discussed prioritizing features and user stories to make clear goals and task distribution for the sprint.
Â  
- **Scrum Meeting**: Four meetings were held where all the members shared their progress on their assigned tasks, discussed pending work, and addressed any problems. These meetings provided opportunities for plan adjustments.

- **Sprint Review:** At the end of sprint0, the team reviewed completed work and gathered feedback to ensure progress met the requirements and expectations before submission. 

- **Sprint Retrospective**: After completing sprint0, the team reflected on successes and areas for improvement to enhance sprint1's efficiency and workflow.
## Lesson for Next Phase
- **Improve time management**: Some tasks may take longer, we will refine our task estimation process and set realistic deadlines.
  
- **More frequent communication:** Encourage team members to raise issues earlier through messaging and meet for discussions
- **Clear task assignments**
