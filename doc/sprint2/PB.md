13. As an office administrator, I want to override present or absent entries made by instructors, in case of mistakes or late attendance.

14. As a high school teacher, I want to mark students as late if they arrive late to the class, so it won't be counted as an absence.

16. As an instructor, I want to add attendance lists at irregular hours and days, so I can track who attended my office hours.
